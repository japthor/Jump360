Original Version:
-----------------
Game: JUMP360 by 111% (example video: https://youtu.be/bSi0D3OdUwU)

This Version:
-----------------
Used: Unity and C#.
Working Time: 6 days.
APK (Android) included if someone wants to try it on their phone. If you can't play it because you have an IOS version or you don't want to play it, I include a small video of the result, and of course the code! 

Notes:
-----------------
Making a similar version of the mobile game called Jump 360. The challenge was to include an additional gameplay element, which I chose powerups, and make it as similar as possible to the original game in one single week.
